        a vivid shade of turquoise that changes in intensity through 
        the summer as the glaciers melt. Set in the rugged Valley of the Ten Peaks, 
        Moraine Lake is surrounded by mountains, waterfalls, and rock piles, 
        creating a scene so stunning it almost seems unreal. 
        Sit lakeside and absorb the sights and pure mountain air, or explore further by canoeing and hiking. 
        It’s an iconically jaw-dropping place that is sure 
        to leave a lasting impression.`,

        longDescription: `Bertha Lake is a stunning, aqua blue lake nestled 
        amongst the mountains and trees that make up the Bertha Lake Trail. 
        It is a wonderful place to stop and enjoy a picnic on the rocks and 
        take in the captivating views that surround you. 
        The Bertha Lake and Bertha Falls Trail begins in the trees and 
        climbs gradually, with occasional glimpses back to Waterton Lake 
        and the townsite. If you’re only going as far as the Lower Bertha Falls, 
        the gentle grade and well-placed benches make it a great 
        hike for people of all ages.
        At the fork at 1.5 km, bear left for a viewpoint. 
        The sweeping vista includes Upper Waterton Lake and the surrounding 
        peaks to the East, including Vimy Peak and Mount Boswell. 
        To the South you can see the International Boundary Line with views 
        into Waterton’s American counterpart, Glacier National Park in Montana. 
        Back on the main trail, the path briefly dips and forks again. 
        Stay right for Bertha Falls and Lake. `,

        longDescription: `Peyto Lake is one of the most famous lakes in 
        Banff National Park. It’s a turquoise blue glacier-fed lake 40 km north 
        of Lake Louise and a popular stop on the famous Icefields Parkway. 
        The brilliant display of blue is fed by the Peyto Glacier high above 
        the lake and part of the Wapta Icefield.
        The viewpoint is one of the most spectacular in all of Banff National 
        Park and a super popular spot for photographers. Peyto Lake, 
        in our opinion, competes for beauty with Moraine Lake without as many visitors. 
        There is little mystery as the lake’s viewpoint 
        is a must for things to do in Banff.`,
